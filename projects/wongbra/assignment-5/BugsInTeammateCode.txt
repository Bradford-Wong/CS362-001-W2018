Bug Report:

Bug #1:

There is a bug that he introduced in line 115 of Appt.java. He changed "if(startHour<0 || startHour>23)"to "if(startHour<15 || startHour > 23)". 
I found this when I set an appointment's startHour to 1 and tried to getthat appointment's valid variable. Due to the bug, the appointment was considered invalid 
when it should've been valid.I then traced trhough the code and tried to see why it was invalid. I then noticed that the appointment's valid variable was set to 
false when it should've been true.This bug can be reproduced by having a startHour value that is less than 15 and then trying to get that appointment's valid variable. 
If you run the CalendarMain class, this bug would cause it to print null for some appointments.

Bug #2

There is another bug that he introduced in line 284 of Appt.java. He changed "printableHour -= 12;" to "printableHour -= 3;". 
This caused a bug where the toString() method printed the wrong output by simply subtracting the hour by 3 (when the hour is greater than 11). 
I found this bug when I set an appointment's startHour to 18 and tested the representationApp() method. The method should have printed that the hour was 6, 
but it printed 15 instead. Due to the bug, the assertion failed and the expected output that the program shouldhave printed was incorrect. This bug can be 
reproduced by setting the startHour to any number greater than 11. The bug will cause it to be decremented the hour by 3, which is incorrect because it should 
actually be subtracted by 12.

Bug #3

There is another bug that he introduced in line 299 of the toString() method in the Appt.java. He changed "getStartDay()" to "getStartYear". 
This causes a bug where the year is printed instead of the day. I found this bug when I tested the toString() method and the assert statement failed 
because the output string was wrong. This bug can be reproduced by having the startDay and startYear different and then testing the toString() method. 
The bug will cause the year to be printed twice. The bug causes the format to be "month/year/year" when it should be "month/day/year".
